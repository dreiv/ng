#Angular 2 example.

This is a simple application done in angular with webpack 2

##How to run the application
To start the example you must have [**node**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed, then while in the project directory run in console these commands:

    1.) npm install
    2.) npm start

## Known issues
Due to the fact that Github pages uses a different file path system, I added in the index.html a bundle loader for both, and one fails :)
